worksLibraryBrowserPara_html=The TBRC Library contains works that span the range of every major literary genre of Tibetan literature.  The shelf list is a browsable view of selected works. Core Text Collections are selected works included in our subscription program to institutions.  The mission of TBRC is to seek out works and organize them in all in a single place.  This library is continually expanding.  Please check back with us often.
topicsLibraryBrowserPara_html=The structure and function of this browsable view of select literary topics is not intended to serve as a comprehensive classification of Tibetan literature, but rather is designed in order to highlight and capture the broad categories we have identified. In this way, each taxonomy is an access point to explore related works.  As we discover and organize more and more literature, we add new categories and update existing ones. We hope that you find this useful.
